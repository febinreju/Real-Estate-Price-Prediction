# Real Estate Price Prediction using Python

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning. The model estimates property prices based on various features like location, size, and other relevant factors. This tool is beneficial for buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed decisions in the real estate market.

## Dataset
The dataset includes several features like:
- Property type (house, apartment, etc.)
- Location (latitude, longitude)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Square footage
- Proximity to amenities (schools, parks, public transport, etc.)
- Dataset used for this project : https://statso.io/real-estate-prediction-case-study/

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment

## Installation
To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/febinreju/real-estate-price-prediction.git
   cd real-estate-price-prediction


## Model
We used various machine learning algorithms to predict property prices, including:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
After comparing the performance of these models, the best performing model was selected based on accuracy and error metrics.

## Usage
To use the model for predictions:

- Run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess the dataset and train the model:
- Jupyter notebook Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb
- You can then use the trained model to predict prices for new properties by providing the required input features.
- Run app.py to get the prediction
